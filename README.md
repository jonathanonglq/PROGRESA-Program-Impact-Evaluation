# PROGRESA Program Impact-Evaluation

## Overall Summary 
The goal of this project is to implement some basic econometric techniques to measure the impact of Progresa on secondary school enrollment rates in Mexico. These methods include T-tests, and linear and multivariate regressions. This project highlights important statistical concepts such as causal inference and spillover effects, rather than predictive analysis. 

## Conclusion 
The project concluded that Progresa did increase the enrollment rates of poor households within Mexico. Perhaps the most compelling evidence comes from the results of the difference-in-difference (tabular and regression) investigation. Even after accounting for the possible effects of control variables on enrollment rates, there is still a relatively large amount of weight (statistically significant) attributed to the progresa variable (and progresa-year interaction term in the regression case).
